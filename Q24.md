JWT (JSON Web Token) and Its Usage in Securing APIs
- 
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit information between parties. It consists of three parts: a header (containing the token type and signing algorithm), a payload (containing claims like user ID), and a signature (to verify authenticity). JWT is commonly used in API authentication and authorization workflows. The server issues a JWT to the client upon login. The client then includes the JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests, and the server verifies the token to ensure secure access to protected resources.
