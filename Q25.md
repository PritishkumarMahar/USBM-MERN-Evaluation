What Does app.use() Do in an Express App?
- 

- In an Express app, app.use() is used to set up middleware. Middleware functions execute during the request-response lifecycle. They can modify the req and res objects, run code, end the request-response cycle, or call next() to pass control to the next middleware. For example, app.use(express.json()) parses incoming JSON data, while custom middleware like logging can use app.use() to log each incoming request. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined in the code.
