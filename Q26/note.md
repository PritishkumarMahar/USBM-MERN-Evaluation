How It Works:

-
- Sticky Navbar: The position: sticky; top: 0; CSS property ensures the navbar remains fixed at the top of the page as you scroll.
- Responsive Design: The layout works well across different screen sizes due to the use of flex and percentage-based padding.
- Sections: Each section has its own ID to allow smooth navigation from the navbar links.
