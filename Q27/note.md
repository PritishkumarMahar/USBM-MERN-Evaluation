
How It Works:
- 
Random Color Generator:
- The getRandomColor function creates a random hexadecimal color code by iterating through 6 characters from the string '0123456789ABCDEF'.

- Button Click Event:
When the button with ID colorButton is clicked, the backgroundColor of the body element is updated with a random color.

- Smooth Transition:
The transition: background-color 0.5s ease; in the CSS ensures a smooth color change effect.
